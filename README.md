# Popular-Site-Subdomains
A list of subdomains for some of the most popular sites on the internet.

# Why?
There are plenty of reasons why people sometimes want a list of subdomains for a website. Whether you're just curious what type of stuff
the company are working on or you want to check for security vulnerabilities, a list of subdomains can really come in handy. Not so long back
someone figured out that he could get in to [anybody's Facebook account](http://www.anandpraka.sh/2016/03/how-i-could-have-hacked-your-facebook.html) 
due the a vulnerability that was only there on their very old subdomains.

# Contribute
The idea behind this is to let everyone contribute and get a fairly big list of subdomains of all the most popular sites on the internet.

Before opening a pull request, please make sure that:

* Each company has their own .txt file, eg. Facebook.txt
* There are no duplicates in the list
* The list is in alphabetical order, [you could use this site to do that](http://alphabetizer.flap.tv/)
* http://, https:// or www. is not in any of the subdomains (as well as no trailing slashes at the end of the domain)
